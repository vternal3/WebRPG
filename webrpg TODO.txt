[ ] Level Up Weapons by equipping them and using them
[ ] Level up materia by having them equiped and using them
[ ] Action RPG
[ ] Combo actions
[ ] Cast magic spells in real time
[ ] Cast buff magic
[ ] 12 or more different spell effects and elements
[ ] Towns with:
	[ ] Smart NPC
	[ ] Armor shops
	[ ] Item shops
	[ ] Specialty shops i.e. job specific items
	[ ] ** maybe special item drops locations in boxes or jars or something
	[ ] Quests from NPC's
	[ ] Quests from builition boards
[ ] Weapons with elemental defenses
[ ] Each monster is particuarly weak against a players elements, but no two players elements are the same weakness.
[ ] Player's will be able to create auto load outs which automatically equip essesnes in choosen slots which are strongest against mobs.
[ ] players learn which essense are strongest against mobs by fighting mobs and looking at historical attack damage done by each type of essense and or skill used against a mob. 
[ ] there will be an achievment for finding out all information of different sets of mobs in the game... i.e. for all mobs in a given region you have discovered all weaknesses and status information about those mobs by fighting them enough times to map out all essense effects as well as learn any new skills the mob uses while attacking you.
[ ] there will also be different loot rewards for killing a mob fast. Each mob will be killable in 5 seconds or less with the correct load out and correct combination of attack and defend rotation. The quicker the mob is killed the more likely you will get better loot.
[ ] there will also be an achievement for killing mobs as fast as possible. Like in Final Fantasy 13.
[ ] monsters have an attack rotation like in Blade and soul, Players can memorize the attack rotation and use counter attacks or spells or defends against the monster. So a monster may attack high then low then middle, and a player may block the high attack or attack low then block the low attack and attack high then block the middle and then counter attack middle or something like this. Think in terms of Fighting games like "soul calibur" where certain attacks counter other attacks.
